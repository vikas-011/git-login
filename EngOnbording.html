                <h3 class="Shwhite">Good onboarding improves retention. Badi onboarding ends in resignation.</h3>
                <h3 class="Shwhite">Based on a study of 2,500+ engineers across 4 years, we've found that although the average time to productivity for a new engineer is 6 – 7 months, there are also clear, measurable ways to reduce that ramp time. The result? A 40% lift in productivity that occurs 2 – 3 months sooner.</h3>
                <h3 class="Shwhite">Pluralsight enables organizations to get new engineering hires contributing to the codebase—and their team—faster. Leaders can coach new hires with objective data on workflow blockers, bottlenecks, and skills gaps. Teams benefit from less friction in the delivery process as new hires join the team. And new hires are more active in the code base, more effective on the team, and more skilled in their role. It's a win-win-win-win (you get it).</h3>
